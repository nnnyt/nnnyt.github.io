I am currently a postgraduate of computer science in the School of Computer Science, [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://www.ustc.edu.cn), and a member of the [BASE Group](http://base.ustc.edu.cn) of [BDAA Lab](http://bigdata.ustc.edu.cn). I am advised by Prof. [Enhong Chen](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~cheneh/). Before that, I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the University of Science and Technology of China in 2021.

My current research interests include natural language processing, data mining and intelligent education.
