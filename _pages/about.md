I am a final-year master student in the School of Computer Science, [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://www.ustc.edu.cn), and a member of the [BASE Group](http://base.ustc.edu.cn) of [BDAA Lab](http://bigdata.ustc.edu.cn). I am advised by Prof. [Enhong Chen](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~cheneh/). I am currently a visiting student in [INK Lab](https://inklab.usc.edu/), University of Southern California, working with Prof. [Xiang Ren](https://shanzhenren.github.io/).

Before that, I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the University of Science and Technology of China in 2021.

My research interests lie in natural language processing, data mining and intelligent education. As for now, I am especially interested in reasoning, generation and evaluation of LLMs. I am also interested in concrete application domains, such as NLP for math and education.
