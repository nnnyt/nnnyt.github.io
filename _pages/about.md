I am a second-year PhD student at [The Ohio State University (OSU)](https://cse.osu.edu/), advised by [Prof. Huan Sun](https://u.osu.edu/ihudas/people/) and working closely with [Prof. Yu Su](https://ysu1989.github.io/). Previously, I obtained my Master's and Bachelor's degrees from [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://www.ustc.edu.cn), advised by [Prof. Enhong Chen](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~cheneh/).

I am broadly interested in NLP and related fields. My current research focuses on **language agents**, with the goal of building and trustworthy AI agents that can reliably assist humans by automating complex or tedious tasks. Recently, my work has explored world modelâ€“based planning for web agents ([WebDreamer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.06559)), evaluation of agents on long-horizon web search tasks ([Mind2Web 2](https://osu-nlp-group.github.io/Mind2Web-2/)) and scientific discovery tasks ([ScienceAgentBench](https://osu-nlp-group.github.io/ScienceAgentBench/)), and agent safety.


Feel free to reach out if you are interested in my research or potential collaborations.
