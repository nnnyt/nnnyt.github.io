I am a second-year PhD student at [The Ohio State University (OSU)](https://cse.osu.edu/), advised by Prof. [Huan Sun](https://u.osu.edu/ihudas/people/). Previously, I obtained my Master's and Bachelor's degrees from [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://www.ustc.edu.cn), advised by Prof. [Enhong Chen](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~cheneh/).


I am broadly interested in NLP and related fields, especially Language Agents and reasoning of Large Language Models.
